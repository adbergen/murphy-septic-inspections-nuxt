              We perform residential septic system inspections for current
              homeowners and prospective real estate purchasers. An onsite
              wastewater treatment and disposal system, or what is more commonly
              referred to as a Septic System, may be the most expensive single
              component of your home. Therefore, if you want to save yourself
              some trouble in the future it's crucial that you know its
              condition and routinely have it checked. <br /><br />

              Getting a septic inspection provides you with information about
              the septic system components and their current operating
              conditions.

              Some local municipalities and New Jersey state regulations require
              a professional residential septic system inspection before
              completion. Murphy's certified and licensed inspectors will
              inspect your residential septic system thoroughly and make the
              process quick and painless.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our inspections typically take about 2 hours though it is
              important to note every system is different and finding the
              components, exposing them, and dealing with any issues that may
              arise can take varied amounts of time. Your residential septic
              inspection report can be ready within 24 hours. We do not perform
              repairs in an effort to prevent conflict of interest in that area.

              An onsite wastewater treatment and disposal system, or Septic
